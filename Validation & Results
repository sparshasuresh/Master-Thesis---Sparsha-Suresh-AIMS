## ðŸ“Š Validation Results

This section presents additional validation plots generated for the sensor fusion pipeline.  
They demonstrate how the **Kalman Filter**, **Bayesian Network**, and **controller** behave under different conditions.

### 1. Kalman Filter vs Ground Truth Trajectory
The Kalman filter tracks the vehicleâ€™s trajectory with reduced noise, providing a stable state estimate closely aligned with CARLA ground truth.

### 2. Bayesian Network Confidence under Varying Weather
System confidence adapts dynamically to environmental conditions.  
- High in **clear** weather  
- Reduced under **rain**  
- Lowest in **fog**  
- Partial recovery in **snow**

### 3. Throttle Adaptation Based on Confidence
The controller automatically reduces throttle in low-confidence situations (e.g., foggy conditions), demonstrating **safety-aware decision-making**.
